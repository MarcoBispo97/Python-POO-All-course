    "# Shallow vs. Deep Copies of an Object:\n",
    "- Now let's see the two different types of copies that you can create when you are working with (lists, tuples, dictionaries, custom objects, and more).\n",
    "- Shallow Copy:\n",
    "    - When you create a shallow copy of an object, you are creating a new object in memory (a new reference).\n",
    "    - However, the elements of the main object will still point to the same objects.\n",
    "    - Let's illustrate this.\n",
    "    - List Example:\n",
    "        - If we have a tuple that contains a list (a mutable object) and we create a clone of the tuple, like this:\n",
    "            ``` python\n",
    "            a = ([0, 6, 2], \"Hello\", 56)\n",
    "            b = a[:]\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        - We might think that this will be the result (please see the diagram below): two independent objects with a different list object in each one them:\n",
    "            ![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "        - But this is not what really happens.\n",
    "            - The tuple only contains a reference to the list object, not to the list object itself.\n",
    "            - This would be a more accurate diagram of the result (taking the list as an example. The other objects are stored as references as well):\n",
    "            ![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "        - So if you modify the list contained in the tuple that is referenced by b, like this:\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "            b[0][0] = -1\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        - You are actually modifying the list in memory, so both tuples are affected since they only contain a reference to the list:\n",
    "            ![image-3.png](attachment:image-3.png)\n",
    "        - That is why the list was modified in both tuples, even if that was not our initial intention. In the following code, you can see the output immediately below each line of code because the code ran in the interactive Python shell.\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "            >>> a\n",
    "            ([-1, 6, 2], 'Hello', 56)\n",
    "            >>> b\n",

    "# ⚠️ You should be really careful with this because it can cause bugs.\n",
    "- Dictionary Example:\n",
    "    - This is another example with the .copy() method that you can call on dictionaries:\n",
    "        ``` python\n",
    "        >>> a = {\"Nora\": [\"055-452-322\", \"Washington Ave.\"], \"Gino\": [\"006-545\", \"5th Avenue\"]}\n",

    "        ```\n",
    "- Shallow copies of dictionaries can be made using `dict.copy()`, and of lists by assigning a slice of the entire list, for example, `copied_list = original_list[:]`.\n",
    "- The copy Module:\n",
    "    - You can also use the copy module to create a shallow copy. To do this, you would just need to import the module with import copy at the top of your script, like this:\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    >>> import copy\n",
    "    >>> a = ([5, 2, 6, 2], \"Welcome\", 67)\n",
    "    >>> b = copy.copy(a)\n",
    "    >>> b[0][0] = -1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # They are both modified\n",
    "    >>> a\n",
    "    ([-1, 2, 6, 2], 'Welcome', 67)\n",
    "    >>> b\n",
    "    ([-1, 2, 6, 2], 'Welcome', 67)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Deep Copy:\n",
    "    - With a deep copy, in addition to creating a copy of the \"container\" object, you also create a copy of each one of the elements that are contained in the object.\n",
    "    - This diagram illustrates what would happen in the previous example if we created a deep copy of the tuple. A new copy of the list would be created for the new copy of the tuple.\n",
    "        - ![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "    - If you modify the list, you will not any affect other names or objects that reference them because they will be new copies.\n",
    "        - ![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "    - To perform a deep copy, you should use the copy module, like this:\n",
    "        ``` python\n",
    "        >>> import copy\n",
    "        >>> a = ([5, 2, 6, 2], \"Welcome\")\n",
    "        >>> b = copy.deepcopy(a)\n",
    "        >>> b[0][0] = -1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Changing the list in b did not affect the list in a\n",
    "        >>> a\n",
    "        ([5, 2, 6, 2], 'Welcome')\n",
    "        >>> b\n",
    "        ([-1, 2, 6, 2], 'Welcome')\n",
    "        ```\n",

    "    - Once you define a tuple, you cannot change the elements that are contained directly within the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - That is why Python does not create a new tuple when you try to clone a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Instead, it assigns a reference to the original tuple in memory to optimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Think about it...\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The purpose of cloning is creating a copy of an object that you can modify without mutating the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - But if we already have an immutable object that cannot be mutated, it makes sense to save space and simply reuse the reference to the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Interesting, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "        - In practice, we cannot really \"clone\" of a tuple. We can only assign a reference to the original tuple to another variable.\n",
