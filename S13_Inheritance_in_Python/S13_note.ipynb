    "    - That is the magic of inheritance.\n",
    "    - ◼️ They Should be Related\n",
    "    - We were able to set up this hierarchy because the two classes were (conceptually) a type of Employee.\n",
    "    - You shouldn't use inheritance only to remove repeated code from your classes because the classes in a hierarchy should be conceptually related.\n",
    "    - For example, Mammal and Reptile could inherit from the class Animal, but not from the class ElectronicDevice.\n",
