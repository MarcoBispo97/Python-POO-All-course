    "# Mini project:\n",
    "- Awesome. Now you work for a software development company that develops software for vending machines in a school district and in a local hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Customize the behavior of the `VendingMachine` class with method inheritance and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To do this, you will define two subclasses: `HospitalVendingMachine` and SchoolVendingMachine. They will inherit from `VendingMachine` (this class is already defined in the Python file that you will download for this project).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requirements for both types of vending machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The subclasses must have a custom greeting message for the user. This message should be displayed before the list of available products.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The code must override the sales_menu method in these two subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - They should print their custom message (shown below) before calling the sales_menu method of the VendingMachine superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For SchoolVendingMachine:\n",
    "        - Welcome to our School Vending Machine \n",
    "        - We hope you have a great day full of learning!\n",
    "    - For HospitalVendingMachine:\n",
    "        - Welcome to our Hospital Vending Machine\n",
    "        - We hope you are feeling better today!\n",
    "    - The subclass should have a class attribute snack_prices. This attribute should replace the value defined in the superclass. You can customize the prices (values) to your liking but please keep the structure of the original dictionary.\n",
    "    - Override the find_snack_price method in both subclasses to make them use the class attribute that corresponds to the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requirements for SchoolVendingMachine:\n",
    "    - Define a class attribute called student_debt (a dictionary with students' names as the keys and their corresponding debt as values).\n",
    "    - Define a method print_student_debt that takes the name of the student as argument and prints the value of the debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requirements for HospitalVendingMachine:\n",
    "    -Define a method called print_days_until_maintenance that prints a string with the number of days remaining until the next scheduled maintenance (this is an instance attribute of the superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I would suggest taking a few minutes to read the code and familiarize yourself with the code. This is intended to help you practice working with existing code and reading code written by other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The code in the downloadable Python file includes descriptive comments that you may find helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code:\n",
    "    - This is the code in the downloadable Python file that you can find below:\n",
