    "# When to Use Class Attributes\n",
    "- ◼️ Defining Constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A common use case is storing constants that are very closely related to the class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In this example, the Earth class has three class attributes, which are constants that are very closely related to the class, so it makes sense to store them under the same structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    class Earth:\n",
    "        MEAN_RADIUS = 6371\n",
    "        EQUATORIAL_RADIUS = 6378.1\n",
    "        EQUATORIAL_CIRCUMFERENCE = 40075.017\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💡 Tip: In Python, there's a naming convention of writing variables that should act like constants in uppercase to signal that their values should not be modified. You may choose to follow this naming convention (or not) based on your personal preferences and the standards followed by your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ◼️ Setting Default Values:\n",
    "    - You can also use class attribute if you need to set a default value for all the instances of the class.\n",
    "    - For example, this IceCream class has a discount class attribute.\n",
    "    - The value of discount will be 15 by default.\n",
    "    - But if a custom value is passed for the discount when the instance is created, the custom value is assigned instead.\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    class IceCream:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        discount = 15\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def __init__(self, discount=None):\n",
    "            if discount is not None:\n",
    "                self.discount = discount\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ◼️ Counting Instances\n",
    "    - Also, if you need to know how many instances of a class have been created, you can use a class attribute to keep track of the counter.\n",
    "    - You should update this counter when you create an instance of the class to make sure that every id will be unique.\n",
    "    - In this example, we have a Customer class with a customer_id class attribute.\n",
    "    - When a new instance is created and initialized, the current value of customer_id is assigned to the id of the instance and then it's incremented by 1, so the next instance will have the updated id.\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    class Customer:\n",
    " \n",
    "    customer_id = 0\n",
    " \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.id = Customer.customer_id\n",
    "        Customer.customer_id += 1    \n",
